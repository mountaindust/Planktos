TODO for dynamic loading of fluid data

dudt needs to be part of FluidData class.
extend
get_2D_vorticity
calculate_DuDt

center_cell_regrid needs to be folded into new FluidData object, because this 
will have to be done on-the-fly as part of dynamic loading.

Support for rectilinear grids needs to update the following methods:
- center_cell_regrid
- calculate_FTLE

Need option for linearly interpolating fluid data in time because it is much 
cheaper in memory.

- 3D time-varying data has not been loaded into Planktos for some time.
- The pipeline was:
    1. Generate data in IBAMR
    2. Batch process samrai data using VisIt. This had to be done in Python 2.x
        because Python 3 was not supported by VisIt. The script to do this is 
        read_IBAMR3d_py27.py in the base directory.
    3. This results in a sequence of vtk files with standardized naming which 
        can be loaded using an environment method.
- Python 3 is now supported since VisIt 3.2, so this script can now be ported 
    and folded into planktos proper.
- VTU (e.g. from COMSOL) was never loaded with time-varying data. This will need
    to be supported.
