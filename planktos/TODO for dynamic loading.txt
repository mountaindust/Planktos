TODO for dynamic loading of fluid data

- 2D and 3D time-varying data has not been loaded into Planktos for some time.
- The pipeline was:
    1. Generate data in IBAMR
    2. Batch process samrai data using VisIt. This had to be done in Python 2.x
        because Python 3 was not supported by VisIt. The script to do this is 
        read_IBAMR3d_py27.py in the base directory.
    3. This results in a sequence of vtk files with standardized naming which 
        can be loaded using an environment method.
- Python 3 is now supported since VisIt 3.2, so this script can now be ported 
    and folded into planktos proper.
- VTU (e.g. from COMSOL) was never loaded with time-varying data. This will need
    to be supported.
- An object needs to be created to handle on-demand dynamic loading. This object 
    will first need to gather time information about the entire dataset and then 
    load the first bit, splining.
- We will need to respline a lot, but most of the data will be the same. I think 
    it's faster to regenerate than to reload.

*** We will have to manually add on to the existing spline (PPoly object) with 
    new intervals while dropping old ones. Resplining the interval is not an 
    option because the new data will create polynomials that are slightly 
    different from the old ones, and that will cause strange things to happen at 
    the breakpoints (e.g., the first derivative will be discontinuous).

- There needs to be a choice about how many to have loaded at any time. 6 is 
probably a minimum. More = more accurate. Let's go with 8.
