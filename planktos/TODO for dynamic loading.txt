TODO for dynamic loading of fluid data

center_cell_regrid needs to be folded into new FluidData object, because this 
will have to be done on-the-fly as part of dynamic loading.

dudt too.

All time-varying fluid data will now be held within a FluidData object.
Fix broken self.flow[0].shape calls that remain, and also [for f in self.flow]

All fluid reading and domain manipulation needs to happen in fluid.py.

- 3D time-varying data has not been loaded into Planktos for some time.
- The pipeline was:
    1. Generate data in IBAMR
    2. Batch process samrai data using VisIt. This had to be done in Python 2.x
        because Python 3 was not supported by VisIt. The script to do this is 
        read_IBAMR3d_py27.py in the base directory.
    3. This results in a sequence of vtk files with standardized naming which 
        can be loaded using an environment method.
- Python 3 is now supported since VisIt 3.2, so this script can now be ported 
    and folded into planktos proper.
- VTU (e.g. from COMSOL) was never loaded with time-varying data. This will need
    to be supported.
