TODO for dynamic loading of fluid data

- 3D time-varying data has not been loaded into Planktos for some time.
- The pipeline was:
    1. Generate data in IBAMR
    2. Batch process samrai data using VisIt. This had to be done in Python 2.x
        because Python 3 was not supported by VisIt. The script to do this is 
        read_IBAMR3d_py27.py in the base directory.
    3. This results in a sequence of vtk files with standardized naming which 
        can be loaded using an environment method.
- Python 3 is now supported since VisIt 3.2, so this script can now be ported 
    and folded into planktos proper.
- VTU (e.g. from COMSOL) was never loaded with time-varying data. This will need
    to be supported.
- An object needs to be created to handle on-demand dynamic loading. This object 
    will first need to gather time information about the entire dataset and then 
    load the first bit, splining.
    - We will need to match cubic splines between loaded subsets of data. I 
        *think* not-a-knot at the ends will allow us to do this...? As long as we
        have at least 6 time points loaded at all times for the 3rd segment in 
        use?
