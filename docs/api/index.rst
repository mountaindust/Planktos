Planktos API
============

Simulations in Planktos are carried out using the environment class, which 
contains all information about the environment (both spatial and temporal), and 
the swarm class, which is a collection of agents sharing a similar motion model.

Planktos provides:
    1. An environment class for agent swarms to move around in
    2. A swarm class for agents
    3. Supporting functions to handle data I/O, solving eqns of motion, etc.
