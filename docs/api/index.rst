Planktos API
============

Simulations in Planktos are carried out using the environment class, which 
contains all information about the environment (both spatial and temporal), and 
the swarm class, which is a collection of agents sharing a similar motion model.

The motion module contains ODE generator functions, an ODE solver, and an SDE 
solver.

The dataio module contains methods for saving and loading data from VTK, STL, 
and other formats.

Select a module from the menu at left to get more information about each of 
these classes and modules, including all of their methods and attributes.
