Velocity2to1_8mmps.vtu is the flow field I sent earlier, but more resolved, with a 30x1000x400 grid. The fluid domain was 100 mm long and 40 mm high, and the width of the domain was set to 3 mm (G/D=2), and the velocity to 8 mm/s. The result is leaky flow.

Velocity2to1_1mmps.vtu has the same dimensions, a 30x1000x400 grid. The fluid domain was 100 mm long and 40 mm high, and the width of the domain was set to 3 mm (G/D=2), and the velocity to 1 mm/s. The result is nonleaky flow.

Velocity0p5to1_8mmps.vtu has a skinnier domain, with a 15x1000x400 grid. The fluid domain was 100 mm long and 40 mm high, and the width of the domain was set to 1.5 mm (G/D=0.5), and the velocity to 8 mm/s. The result is nonleaky flow.  

The same cylinder is used for each with the same positioning.
